Technically there are a few different configurations of  __bewegungsappar.at__ we have currently deployed.

## woodenboard
The one which might be most familliar for most of you is the __woodenboard__. It is designed using computer-aided designed base plate. The base plate was then cut using a CNC router.
__woodenboard__ was constructed to carry a Mate crate lengthways _or_ to fit one eurobox/two beverage crates orthogonal. Thus it can either be used as a transport vehicle or for cruising around by utilising the single crate as a seat.

## psychos' board
Bigger, more advanced and more durable than the woddenboard is psychos' __bewegungsappar.at__. It is longer, allowing it to carry up to three beverage crates on it's baseplate.

__psychos' board__ is build using lightweight aluminium profiles.
This makes it possible to be used as a human transportation device as well.

## paddelec
The most advanced version of __bewegungsappar.at__ currently depolyed is __paddelec__.
The central part is an kayak.
The kayak is mounted to a welded frame.

While the base is uses uses our modified [software](/post/software/) version the control unit is even more special.
__paddelec__ is controlled with a gyro-equipped paddle.

It's futuristic design does make it look even faster.
And the trailer is only a small hint about its danger.
